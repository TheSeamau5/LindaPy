Instructions:

Prerequisites:
    - Python3
    - ply (Python Lex-Yacc package)

Install Ply for Python 3:
    - run "pip3 install ply"

Once installed, you have all that you need to run P2

P2 is split between a client application and a server application

To run the server:
    - Go to P2 directory ("cd P2")
    - run "python server"

A server should now be running with the following output

    Starting new session with name: 61ed69ed5cfc4b08a4d15c05fb3432a8
    Starting server on 10.0.0.59 port: 52971
    Waiting for input


The name printed there is the name of the subdirectory where this server is running.
Furthermore, the server address and port number is displayed.
The server is now running and is just waiting for input.

To run the client:
    - Open a new window
    - Go to P2 directory ("cd P2")
    - run "python client 61ed69ed5cfc4b08a4d15c05fb3432a8"
    (replace the session name with the one actually displayed by the server)

Now, you should be presented with a prompt

    linda>

You may enter a linda command there and you will get a response

If you wish to run a new server, open a new window and repeat the above steps.

Suppose you want to add run a second server:
    - run "python server"
    - open new window and run "python client <new server name>"

The new client will present you with the prompt

    linda>

Now, from the prompt, add the first server as follows

    linda> add 10.0.0.59 52971


This will automatically link the new server to the first server, no need to perform the add on the other server.

This will also hold for any subsequent server you create.
Just run add any of the previous linda servers from the new server and now your new server will join Linda.

If you wish to restore a server session, simply pass the name when you run "python server".
